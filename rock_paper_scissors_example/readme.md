# Rock Paper Scissors
In this little pet project that I wrote, you can check out how to do the following:

1. Using Python Classes and methods:
  - Create your own data structure through Python's classes.
  - Create methods for your data types using classes
2. Using proper Control Flow
  - Use For Loops to iterate through a list
  - Use While Loops for managing work flows
3. Using code modularization and improving readability.
  - In addition, making some code be more flexible depending to make it such that you can add
  your own code to make your Ultimate Rock, Paper, Scissors!
4. Using imports of the vast tools that python provides you to make your code robust and powerful.
  - Using regex (REGular EXpressions) to find close matches to a word in a list.
  - Using rand (Not cryptographically secure!) to generate random numbers to 
5. Checking user input.
  - Note: I did not implement Control Code statements (things like Ctrl-C (^C), or Ctrl-D(^D)),
  so there will be some error messages if you try to kill the program using SIGINT or SIGKILL
  codes!

There is alot happening here, but since it's super early in the semester, you can use this as a reference
to kind of piece together what your code **should** resemble by the end of the semester.

Peace, love, unity and respect :)
